# This code was written to discover how many statefulsets exist in the namespace
# however if the namespace does get deleted and a failure happens somewhere in the
# pipeline, it's likely we will have a partially removed deployment and never be able
# to remove the rest. Instead we should always assume 3 total nodes, and remove the
# namespace and make sure any and all possible IP's are removed as well.
# We also only attempt to connect to controller addresses that we've found.
